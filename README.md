# Overfitting


This project demonstrates the use of a decision tree classifier to detect overfitting in a binary classification problem using synthetic data.

## Problem Description

The dataset consists of 1500 instances, each labeled as 0 or 1 for a binary classification task. Class 1 instances follow three Gaussian distributions with means at [6, 14], [10, 6], and [14, 14], while class 0 instances have a uniform distribution with 20 instances.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the notebook [Week9Overfitting_Unsupervised.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z4zfi8EwhM6krygBLozuRHRN_WMSlf6n#scrollTo=pgLFiaLuRtpW&printMode=true) in Google Colab.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
3. The notebook will generate synthetic data, split it into training and test sets, train a decision tree classifier with various maximum depths, and evaluate its performance.
4. The notebook also exports the trained decision tree to a file and displays it as an image.
